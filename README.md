# VPF: Variational potential flow

Application that can simulate potential flow
using a variational formulation.

For details on the formulation see:

 Ocean Engineering 201 (2020): 107114.

"A monolithic finite element formulation for the
hydroelastic analysis of very large floating structures."
International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering 124.3 (2023):714-751.

The parallel application is build on [mfem](https://github.com/mfem/mfem), a
lightweight, general, scalable C++ library for finite element methods.

## Install -- Local

To install VPF on a Ubuntu-based machine make sure the appropriate packages are installed.

Before installing the packages make sure the machine is updated, by running the folliwing commands in a terminal:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

Install the required packages by running the following command in a terminal:

```
sudo apt-get install cmake git build-essential openmpi-common libopenmpi-dev libmetis5 libmetis-dev
```

The VPF code can be downloaded using the following command:

```
git clone git@github.com:IdoAkkerman/vpf.git

```
or
```
git clone https://github.com/IdoAkkerman/vpf.git

```
This will create a directory `vpf` with the code in it. This code can be compiled using the following commands:

```
cd vpf
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j 16
```

Here the number 16 is the number of files that will be compiled concurrently.
NB: This number you choose should depend on the number of cores you have available.

Depending on the machine compilation might take a few minutes.
After this hypre and MFEM will be installed in the `build/external` directory, and
the vpf executable can be found in the `bin` directory.


## Test Cases


2D test cases:
1. ?? `cases/poiseuille`
2. ?? `cases/lid-driven-cavity`


3D test cases: tbd
1. ??
2. ??

## Run
The code can be run by running
```
$BUILD/bin/vpf
```

Where `$BUILD` is the directory where `cmake` was run.

To see all the command line options run:
```
$BUILD/bin/vpf -h
```

### Isogeometric


### GMSH

GMSH is an open-source mesher. On Ubuntu-based machine the package can be installed
using the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install gmsh
```

### Visualization using Visit

The results can be visualized using [Visit] https://visit-dav.github.io/visit-website/index.html.
Which is an open-source tool that can natively visualize NURBS based solutions.
